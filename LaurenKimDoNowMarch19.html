The Spellbook of Magic, the book that contains the power to do anything and everything. It was just what Sir Lothar needed. Poor Sir Lothar, he is simply a tired knight, forced to fight creatures of evil all day and night. If he could get his hands on this oh-so-magical spellbook, then he would be </span><span class="c3">able</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to fix all his problems. Everything. Or so he thought. The sleep deprived knight marched into the welcoming city, who knew that he was coming which confused him. Looking puzzled, Sir Lothar asked an old lady what was happening, &ldquo;Miss? Do you know what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; But, the old lady didn&rsquo;t answer and just tilted her head to follow her. Sir Lothar walked closely behind her, as they were approaching the center of the city, there it was, the Spellbook of Magic. Sir Lothar ran towards the light the book emitted, its golden glow was mesmerizing. Astonished, he carefully held the rough book in his hands, &ldquo;Whoa.. This is the answer to my problems!&rdquo; With starry eyes, he opened it, only to find it blank. He turned another page, only to find it blank again. His eyebrows were furrowed in frustration, he turned to the old lady once more. &ldquo;Why is the book blank? It&rsquo;s supposed to be able to do everything?&rdquo; The old lady spoke in her raspy voice, &ldquo;Dear, this book may be known for its ability to do anything, it is far too old to do so anymore. You&rsquo;ve come all this way to fix your problems, but this book is not the answer to your troubles.&rdquo; The knight gripped onto the book, desperately speaking, &ldquo;Then what am I supposed to do? Surely there must be something!&rdquo; &nbsp;The old lady came closer to him in slow strides, &ldquo;The answer&hellip; is you. It has been with you all this time, look into your bag.&rdquo; Sir Lothar reached into his bag and took out a warm bottle of milk. &ldquo;This will fix your sleeping problems.&rdquo;</span></p></body></html>
