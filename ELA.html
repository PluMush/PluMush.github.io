                <p id="Collage">For the photo collage, we were supposed to make a collage using our own photos we took and the ones we find on the internet. I took the two photos in the center. My photo collage is based on this sentence found in my textbook: “The sad room smiles again when a pot of green is placed on a white tablecloth.” I wanted to find photos that had a simple background and lighting that made it look as if the plant is the room’s savior to its boringness. </p>

I have a tendency to repeatedly write sentences using the same structure. I tried to make things less repetitive by adding a plot twist at the end and using different structures. </p>

                <p id="Sonnet">Poems are my weakness. I have struggled with ideas, structure, and the way the words flow. But for this one, it’s not too bad compared to the ones that I have made a long time ago. We were tasked to write a sonnet, which is a form of poetry that is fourteen lines long and rhymes. I used my morning routine as an inspiration since I was tired that day. It is about a person not wanting to leave their bed to go to school. </p>
