                <p id="Story">I used text and image generating AI to write and illustrate this storybook! I learned to prompt the
                    AI correctly in order to get the results I wanted. The AI would prioritize the words at the
                    beginning than the ones closer to the end. I struggled with getting the right images the most,
                    sometimes the AI would generate one thing right but the other would be wrong. The easiest part of
                    this project would be generating the text I want.</p>

                <p id="Cube">I used TinkerCAD to make this 3x3x3 LED cube. TinkerCAD is a program that allows you to
                    create 3D objects, test physics, test circuits, and 3d print your creations. I first had to learn
                    how energy flows in a circuit, basic parts of a circuit, and basic C++ coding. When turned on, the
                    LEDs should make different patterns by turning on or off specific LEDs. If I were to do this project
                    again, I would brainstorm more ideas on how I want the LEDs to light up.</p>

                <p id="Obstacle">For the Sphero Obstacle Course, we combined everyone’s ideas together to create one big
                    course for the Sphero RVR. Sphero RVR is a programmable robot car that allows you to be creative. We
                    tested it multiple times and took measurements to be accurate as much as possible. It was enjoyable
                    to see others’ ideas. We made our ideas by using cardboard, VEX pieces, and other supplies.</p>

                <h3 id="CMW">Cardboard Microbit Worm</h3>
                <p id="Microbit">Our goal for this project was to make a moving worm using TinkerCAD and Micro:bit. My
                    partner and I worked together on TinkerCAD to make the 3D pieces needed. We had to watch a video on
                    hinges so we wouldn’t make a mistake and need to print again. Taking measurements was also pretty
                    important for the hinges. When it was printed, unfortunately, our worm was a pretty small size
                    compared to the others. So, the weight of the Micro:bit and the servo slowed down the worm and made
                    it harder to move. We would have changed the overall size to a larger one if we could improve it.
