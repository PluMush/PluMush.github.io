                <p id="Resistent">we learned a lot about natural disasters and human-caused disasters as well. For this project, we were required to design and build a house that could stay together even after an earthquake using the materials we got. The materials we were allowed to use were clay and popsicle sticks. I designed my house to be short and not tall, thatâ€™s because I remember reading an article about why buildings in Japan are generally shorter than normal. Finally, after testing it out, my house successfully survived the earthquake simulation. </p>

                <p id="Fossils">Another project we did was making clay fossils! I chose to make crinoids. Crinoids still exist today, they are known as sea lilies and are related to starfish and sea urchins. I tried to shape the clay to look as close as to the reference picture as possible. Making the little rings around the stalk using my nails was the hardest part in this project. The easiest part was the tentacle-like arms it had. I just had to get a small strip of clay and roll it around using the inside of my palms to achieve the look.  </p>
