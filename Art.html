                <p id="Art">I used Sketchbook to make one small design before duplicating several copies to make a pattern. I wanted to use high saturated colors to make it feel like there is a lot of things going on. I used the things I like to put in the artwork: Inky Cap mushrooms, eyeballs, flowers, and checkered patterns. I learned different ways on positioning the copies of the drawings to give the effect I want.</p>

                <p id="Hand">Zentangle is a method of art. It is drawn with many different patterns using dots, lines, curves, etc. We first had to practice with a couple of different patterns like the checkered pattern on another sheet of paper. After that, we got onto the actual project. We then had to draw around our hand, getting the outline and start making patterns inside the outline. This was pretty fun and relaxing. I had some difficulty thinking of new patterns and deciding which colors I want.</p>
